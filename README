# What is it

A wrapper for make which logs to /tmp/mymake.err and a Vim macro to load the
log output as if compilation was started from Vim, making it possible to use
Vim functions to jump through errors.

# Installation

1. Copy mymake in your PATH.

2. Install the Vim plugin:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
    cp mymake.vim ~/.vim/plugin

mymake uses make by default but you can overload it with the MAKEPRG
environment variable.
